# Aggregation of Trapezoidal Linguistic Terms

The Aggregation of Trapezoidal Linguistic Terms project is a web-based application that enables the aggregation of linguistic terms represented as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers using HTML and JavaScript. This project is particularly valuable in fuzzy logic systems and decision-making processes where linguistic terms need to be aggregated to facilitate informed decision-making.
